# ðŸ“ˆ TradingAgent

**TradingAgent** is a coursework project focused on comparing **rule-based algorithms** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based algorithms** for portfolio management. The project further investigates the impact of including cryptocurrencies on overall portfolio performance.

This work utilizes the **FinRL framework** developed by the AI4Finance Foundation to implement and simulate DRL-based trading strategies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

- Compare **rule-based methods** (e.g., Minimum Variance Optimization, Naive Diversification, Mean-Variance Optimization, Rolling Mean-Variance Optimization) with **DRL-based methods** (A2C, PPO, DDPG, SAC, TD3, and Ensemble strategies) in managing multi-asset portfolios.
- Evaluate how the **inclusion of cryptocurrencies** affects portfolio performance across different strategies.
- Use real-world financial data spanning stocks and crypto assets to simulate realistic trading environments.

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

Prepared datasets used in experiments:

- `2007-2025_no_crypto.csv`  *(Stock-only portfolio)*
- `2015-2025_crypto.csv`      *(Crypto-focused portfolio)*
